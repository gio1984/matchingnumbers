Excel addin checks numbers sum to zero

I developed this Excel addin that helps people matching sums and numbers to zero. It is very useful in accountacy's office.

It checks pairs sums ( ex. 10 + (-10) = 0) and check combinations of numbers that sum to zero.

If you want to contribute, we should improve its speed.
